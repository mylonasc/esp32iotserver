## IoT OS for ESP32 boards
This is a fairly versatile IoT OS for ESP32 boards. 

Its features include:
* Wifi provisioning (when the ESP32 cannot connect to the wifi it is configured for it is going in "provisioning mode". 
* Setup and reading from humidity sensors (+ labeling and an endpoint for getting averaged readings)
* Setup and use of water pumps (timing-based)
* Servo control
* A web UI which exposes most of the functionality.
